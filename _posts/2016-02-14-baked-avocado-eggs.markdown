Preheat oven to 425 deg.

Cut the <span>2 ripe avocados</span> in half lengthwise and use the spoon to scoop out the pit. Scoop a small amount of the avocado out, to make room for the egg. 

Place avocados in a small baking dish, arranged snugly so the avocados won't move. 

Crack <span>4 eggs</span>into a small bowl, keeping the yolks intact. Spoon a yolk into each avocado, then spoon egg white into avocados until full.

Sprinkle <span>1/4 tsp. paprika</span> evenly over eggs and avocados.

Place baking dish in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until egg is firm. Baking time will vary depending on size of avocados and egg.
