Fill a large pot with water and a dash of salt. Bring to a boil.

Rinse and scrub the <span>2 pounds small new potatoes</span> and add to boiling water. Boil for 10 - 15 minutes, or until almost tender when pierced with a fork.

Drain water and set boiled potatoes on a flat surface. Use the palm of your hand to squish the potatoes to about half their original height. 

Add the <span>1/2 cup oil (canola, olive, etc)</span> to the frying pan and heat to medium high.

Add the potatoes to frying pan (they should sizzle). Reduce heat to medium low and cook for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side for 10 minutes. 

Add a sprinkle of <span>coarse salt</span> and serve hot.
