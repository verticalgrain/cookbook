Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Scoop <span>3 tbsp. coconut oil</span> into an oven safe dish and place in oven to liquify while oven preheats.

Lightly grease the muffin pan.

Open the <span>1 15 oz can black beans</span> and rinse beans thoroughly in a colander.

In blender or food processor, combine the <span>3 tbsp. coconut oil,</span> <span>black beans,</span> <span>3/4 cup cocoa powder,</span> <span>1/4 tsp. sea salt,</span> <span>1 tsp. vanilla extract,</span> <span>1/2 cup organic cane sugar,</span> <span>1 1/2 tsp. baking powder</span>

Blend for 1 minute or until black bean skins are completely dissolved. If mixture is too thick to blend easily, add 1 tbsp. water.

Pour mixture into large mixing bowl and mix in <span>2 eggs</span>

Evenly distribute the mixture into the muffin pan slots.

Bake for 25 minutes or until brownies edges start to pull away from side of muffin pan.

Let cool for 30 minutes before eating.
