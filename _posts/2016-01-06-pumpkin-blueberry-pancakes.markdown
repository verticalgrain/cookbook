Preheat oven to 200˚F.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the:
	<span>1¼ cups flour,</span>
	<span>2 tsp. <i></i>baking powder,</span>
	<span>¼ tsp. salt,</span>
	<span>¾ tsp. cinnamon,</span>
	<span>¼ tsp. nutmeg,</span>
	<span>dash ginger</span>

In a small mixing bowl, combine the:
	<span>1 cup milk,</span>
	<span>½ cup pumpkin,</span>
	<span>1 egg,</span>
	<span>2 tbsp. oil or butter</span>

Stir into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.

Pour batter on a greased griddle or skillet heated to medium heat (325˚F). The pancakes won't spread much, so use the back of a spoon to shape into a circle if desired. Sprinkle blueberries on top. Flip when bubbles begin forming on top. Cook until golden brown.

Place pancakes on the baking sheet and pop in the oven to warm until served.

Serve with maple syrup, fruit, or whatever you like.
