Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the <span>2-3 pieces pita bread</span> into 8 wedges. Arrange wedges in a flat layer on the baking sheet.

Mince the <span>2 cloves garlic</span> and combine with the <span>3 tbsp. olive oil</span> in a bowl.

Brush the oil mixture onto each pita wedge. Flip the pita wedges and brush the oil mixture onto the other side.
