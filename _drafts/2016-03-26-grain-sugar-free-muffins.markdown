Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Chop the <span>3 cloves garlic,</span> <span>1 large onion,</span> <span>1 cups mushrooms</span>

Heat <span>1 tbsp. coconut oil</span> in a pan over medium high heat. Add the chopped garlic and onions, as well as the <span>1/2 tbsp. salt,</span> <span>1/2 tbsp. black pepper</span> and saute until onions are soft, about 7 minutes.

Lay the <span>2 pounds flank steak</span> on a cutting board and spread the onion mushroom mixture on top. Then lay the <span>4 leaves spinach</span> on top of the mixture, and top that with the <span>10 slices provolone cheese</span>

Roll the steak into a roll, making sure the grain of the meat is running horizontally. Insert six toothpicks into the roll to hold it together. Slice the roll into six equal rolls.

Heat <span>1 tbsp. coconut oil</span> in a pan over high heat. Sear the steak rolls for 1-2 minutes on each side. 

Move the steak rolls to a baking dish and bake for 10-15 minutes or until medium rare.
